# How They Test
> A collection of publicly available resources on how software companies in the world test their software systems and build their quality culture.


## Foreword
One of the outcomes of the various [Taqelah](https://www.meetup.com/taqelah/) meetups was that many software companies got to share their testing and quality culture with the community. It was absolutely fantastic to see the amazing stuff companies are doing to test their software, and ensure quality of their products and platforms. 

Apart from this, many companies regularly come forward and share their best practices, tools, techniques and culture of software testing on various public platforms like conferences, blogs & meetups. The resources are there but dispersed, lost into the internet.

There is no single knowledge repository that gives a direct look at these best practices, tools, techniques and culture of software testing these companies adopt. This repository intends to do that.

Happy Learning!

*Please note, that all the resources mentioned here are publicly available resources.*
